    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. For each parameter value of `rank`, a specific set of parameters for the simulation can then be associated. For example, if `rank` is 0 the simulation should run for the parameters $A = 1$, $B = 2$ and $C = 3$. If rank is 1, it should run the simulation for the values $A = 4, B = 5, C = 6$ and so on. The parameters could be stored in a dictionary within the main file, but they could also be read in from a vsc or excel file.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Finally, if everything is set up, you can submit the job using: `sbatch jobs_gpu.slrm` (Replace jobs by the name of the slrm script.) If necessary, the job can be cancelled using `scancel JOBID`, where JOBID is a number associated to the submitted job. If you want to look the number up, use: `qs`. To get more detailed information about who is running which job on which GPU you can type `qs_gpu_all`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Note that the latter commands first need to be defined in the .bashrc file. To do so, go to your home folder on the VSC cluster and type  `vim .bashrc`. Within this file you then need to adjust the lines `alias qs_gpu_all = \"squeue | grep 0x2\" ` and `alias qs = \"squeue -uuser_name\"`. Of course you could define them differently, if you wanted.\n",
